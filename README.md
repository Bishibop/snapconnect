## Share Your Art. Find Your Vibe. Get Vibed.

A creative community for artists to share and discover art that resonates with their unique aesthetic. Built for creators who believe art is more than just images - it's about finding your tribe through shared creative energy.

### Who It's For

- **Visual Artists** looking to connect with like-minded creators
- **Digital Creators** wanting to showcase their work in meaningful collections
- **Art Enthusiasts** eager to discover fresh perspectives and support emerging talent
- **Creative Communities** building connections through shared aesthetic sensibilities

### How VibeReels Work

The core feature of this app is the **VibeReel** mechanic - a way to create and share artistic narratives:

1. **Create Your Art** - Share your original artwork with the community
2. **Curate Your Vibe** - Select complementary pieces from other artists that match your aesthetic
3. **Build Your Story** - Combine your art with others' to create short, visual story collections called VibeReels
4. **Share the Energy** - Post your VibeReels to friends and watch your creative network grow

### Getting "Vibed"

When another artist includes your work in their VibeReel, you've been **"Vibed"** - a sign that your art resonates with others in the community. You can track your Vibes to see who's connecting with your work and discover artists with similar aesthetics.
