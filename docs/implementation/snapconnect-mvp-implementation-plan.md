# SnapConnect MVP Implementation Plan

## Epic Overview

Build a complete ephemeral messaging app with React Native and Supabase, featuring disappearing photos, real-time friend connections, 24-hour stories, and simple filters. The implementation is already complete through Phase 1.

## Supporting Documents

- Epic Brief: `/docs/epic-briefs/snapconnect-mvp.md`
- Technology Stack: `/docs/architecture/technology-stack.md`
- System Architecture: `/docs/architecture/system-architecture.md`

## Epic Implementation Guide

**General Workflow for Epic Implementation:**

- **Kickoff** - Read the supporting documents listed above, review epic requirements with user, confirm overall approach
- **Implementation** - Work through phases sequentially using the Phase Implementation Guide
- **Completion** - Present completed epic to user, prompt user to verify against epic brief requirements, update system architecture document based on actual implementation, prompt user to do epic retrospective, get sign-off on the complete implementation

## Phase Implementation Guide

**General Workflow for Each Phase:**

- **Kickoff** - Review phase requirements with user, ask clarifying questions about preferences and approach
- **Implementation** - Build the entire phase independently, making reasonable technical decisions
- **Completion** - Present completed phase to user, prompt user to verify against phase requirements, get sign-off before proceeding

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Social Platform âœ… COMPLETED

**Overview**
Establish the foundation with authentication, friend connections, photo sharing, and stories - all with real-time updates.

**User Experience**

- Users can sign up and log in
- Users can search for and add friends
- Users can take photos and send them to friends
- Users can view received photos for 5 seconds
- Users can post and view 24-hour stories
- Users can apply simple filters to photos

**Technical Implementation**

- Authentication with Supabase Auth
- Database schema with RLS policies
- Friend management system
- Camera integration with Expo Camera
- Snap sending/receiving with real-time updates
- Story system with auto-expiration
- Filter system with react-native-image-filter-kit
- 4-tab navigation structure

**Scope Limitations**

- No video recording (deferred)
- No push notifications
- No text messaging
- No AR filters

**Verification**

- âœ… Users can complete full authentication flow
- âœ… Friend requests work bidirectionally
- âœ… Photos can be captured and sent
- âœ… Snaps disappear after viewing
- âœ… Stories expire after 24 hours
- âœ… Real-time updates work across app
- âœ… Filters can be applied to photos

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Features (Planned)

**Overview**
Enhance the app with AI capabilities including smart captions, content recommendations, and conversation starters.

**User Experience**

- AI suggests captions for photos
- Personalized content recommendations
- Smart friend suggestions
- AI-powered conversation starters

**Technical Implementation**

- OpenAI API integration
- pgvector for embeddings
- Recommendation engine
- Caption generation system
- Content analysis pipeline

**Scope Limitations**

- Basic AI features only
- No complex image analysis
- No real-time AI processing

**Verification**

- AI captions are relevant and appropriate
- Recommendations improve over time
- System handles API limits gracefully
- Privacy is maintained

### Phase 3: Enhanced Media & AR (Future)

**Overview**
Add video support, AR filters, and advanced camera features.

**User Experience**

- Record and send video snaps
- Apply AR face filters
- Use location-based filters
- Create custom stickers

**Technical Implementation**

- Video recording with Expo Camera
- AR framework integration
- Face detection system
- Custom filter creation tools
- Location services integration

**Scope Limitations**

- Limited AR filter set initially
- No user-generated AR filters
- Basic video editing only

**Verification**

- Video recording works on all devices
- AR filters track faces accurately
- Performance remains smooth
- Storage usage is optimized

### Phase 4: Growth & Monetization (Future)

**Overview**
Add features for user growth, engagement, and potential monetization.

**User Experience**

- Discover section for public content
- Snap streaks and gamification
- Premium filters and features
- Creator tools and analytics

**Technical Implementation**

- Discovery algorithm
- Streak tracking system
- Payment integration
- Analytics dashboard
- Creator monetization tools

**Scope Limitations**

- Start with basic monetization
- Limited creator tools initially
- Regional restrictions may apply

**Verification**

- Discovery algorithm surfaces relevant content
- Payment processing is secure
- Analytics are accurate
- Creator tools are intuitive

## Current Status

### âœ… Phase 1: COMPLETE

All core features implemented and working:

- Authentication system
- Friend management
- Photo capture and sharing
- Disappearing messages
- 24-hour stories
- Simple filters
- Real-time updates
- Performance optimizations

### ðŸ”„ Ready for Phase 2

The codebase is well-structured and ready for AI integration. Consider:

1. Setting up OpenAI API credentials
2. Adding pgvector to Supabase
3. Designing AI feature UX
4. Planning data collection for personalization

## Technical Notes

### Established Patterns

- Foreign key constraint naming: `{table}_{column}_fkey`
- Real-time subscription pattern with cleanup
- Lazy cache initialization for performance
- Error boundaries for graceful failures
- Atomic cache operations

### Performance Achievements

- Instant camera initialization
- Selective real-time updates
- Efficient memory management
- Proper cleanup on unmount

### Code Quality

- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint configured
- Prettier formatting
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive documentation
