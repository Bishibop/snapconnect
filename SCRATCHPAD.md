# SnapConnect Development Scratchpad

## Phase 1 Progress & Lessons Learned

### ✅ Completed: Friends Management System
- **Status**: Fully implemented with real-time updates
- **Key Learning**: Supabase foreign key constraints need explicit naming for relationship queries
- **Pattern Established**: `{table}_{column}_fkey` constraint naming convention

### 🔧 Critical Setup Patterns for Future Features

#### Database Schema Requirements
```sql
-- Always use explicit foreign key constraints
CONSTRAINT snaps_sender_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

-- Always enable realtime
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE {table_name};
```

#### Service Query Pattern
```typescript
// Use explicit constraint names in queries
friend_profile:profiles!friendships_friend_id_fkey(*)
```

#### Real-time Subscription Pattern
```typescript
const subscription = supabase
  .channel('{feature}-changes')
  .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: '{table}' }, handler)
  .subscribe();
```

### 🚧 Known Issues to Monitor
1. **Friend Removal Real-time**: Complex OR delete queries don't trigger real-time properly
2. **Empty List Pull-to-refresh**: Only works when list has content
3. **Migration Cleanup**: Remove `002_friendships.sql` when convenient

### ⚠️ Dependency Warnings (Camera System)
1. **expo-av deprecation**: Will be removed in SDK 54, need to migrate to `expo-audio` and `expo-video`
2. **CameraView children warning**: Current implementation puts controls as children inside CameraView, should use absolute positioning instead

### 📋 Next Phase 1 Features (in order)
1. **✅ Camera System** 📸
   - **✅ Photo capture working**
   - **❌ Video recording** (deferred - Android permission issues)
   - **📝 Next: Media compression before upload**

2. **Snap Sharing** 📱
   - Supabase Storage for media files
   - Real-time snap delivery
   - Status tracking (sent/delivered/opened)

3. **Stories** 📰
   - 24-hour expiration
   - Unified feed with snaps
   - Auto-cleanup with edge functions

4. **Simple Filters** 🎭
   - `react-native-image-filter-kit`
   - Post-capture only for MVP

### 🎥 Video Recording - Deferred
- **Issue**: Android microphone permissions causing "Recording was stopped before any data could be produced"
- **Decision**: Focus on photo-only MVP first, revisit video later
- **Files to clean up later**: `CaptureButton.tsx`, `TestRecording.tsx`

### 🏗️ Architecture Decisions Made
- **State Management**: React built-in (useState/useContext) instead of Zustand
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime for instant updates
- **Navigation**: React Navigation Stack (no tabs yet)
- **Styling**: React Native StyleSheet with theme constants

### 🎯 MVP Scope Boundaries
- **No push notifications** (real-time only when app open)
- **No text messages** (visual snaps only)
- **No conversation threads** (individual snaps)
- **Simple color filters only** (no AR/face tracking)

### 📚 Reference Documentation
- Working database schema: `docs/TECH_STACK.md`
- Feature specifications: `docs/PHASE_1.md`
- Constraint naming patterns documented for copy-paste

### 🔄 Development Workflow Established
1. Update `TECH_STACK.md` with proper schema patterns
2. Create migration with explicit constraints
3. Enable realtime publication
4. Build service functions with constraint names
5. Implement UI with real-time subscriptions
6. Test end-to-end flow

### 💡 Performance Notes
- Database indexes are well-planned for query patterns
- Real-time subscriptions have proper cleanup
- Foreign key cascades prevent orphaned data
- RLS policies secure all operations

### 🚀 Ready for Next Feature
The friends system provides a solid foundation. Camera system should be next since it's core to the snap-sharing experience. All database patterns and real-time setup are established and documented.
